### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

  For the test, I used React and made my own stylesheet. I was having issues with react-bootstrap so I just styled everything and implemented the carousel from scratch. I also used Green Sock for the animations.

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

    I had uses with react-bootstrap so I had to change my strategy completely. I also tried setting up Tailwind but that wasn't working either. Making components, text, and margin/padding responsive while maintaining the layout design wasn't easy. 

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why

  I liked depending on my own stylesheet, I rarely never use bootstrap for components so it was an interesting challenge. I also liked using Green Sock for the animations. It was pretty user friendly and simple. I wanted to create a parallax effect with the banner images but I couldn't implement it the way I wanted.
